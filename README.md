**Project overview**

## Modeling 27 Years of Community Composition at Lizard Island Reef (1995-2022): Exploring the Impact of Multiple Interacting Climate Change Factors on Corals

Aim:
- To model the effects of climate change on the coral reef benthic community


Objectives: 
1. Understand the trends in coral cover on Lizard Island Reef over a 27-year period
2. Determine the effects of multiple environmental stressors on coral ecosystems
3. Suggest which environmental stressors may have the greatest impact on corals

---
Analysis Plan:
1. Model change in hard coral cover over time
2. Model change in the coral benthic community over time
3. Model the relationship between major disturbance events and coral benthic community

Data collection: 
- Ecological surveys were conducted at Lizard Island reef between 1995 and 2022 as part of the AIMS Fixed sites long term monitoring program
- Sites were sampled every year from 1995 to 2005, and every second year from 2005 to 2022 which resulted in 20 different time points
- There are three sites at Lizard reef that consists of 5x50 m transects
- Each transect is positioned parallel to the reef slope using a line of tape

Data files:
- 'Lizard_totalcover.csv': each row represents a type of species within a transect with a value under the column 'cover' which represents the total cover of that species within that transect
- 'lizdat.csv': This data is based on the raw 'Lizard_totalcover.csv' data. The rows represent the different transects (1 to 300: 15 transects x 20 years) and the columns represent the different types of identified benthic groups
- 'lizfac.csv': The rows in this file correspond to the same rows in the 'lizdat.csv' file. The columns represent the year, site no., and transect no. for each of the transects
