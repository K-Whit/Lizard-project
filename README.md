**Project overview**

## Modeling 27 Years of Community Composition at Lizard Island Reef (1995-2022): Exploring the Impact of Multiple Interacting Climate Change Factors on Corals

Aim:
- To model the effects of climate change on the coral reef benthic community


Objectives: 
1. Understand the trends in coral cover on Lizard Island Reef over a 27-year period
2. Determine the effects of multiple environmental stressors on coral ecosystems
3. Suggest which environmental stressors may have the greatest impact on corals

---
Analysis Plan:
1. Model change in hard coral cover over time
2. Model change in the coral benthic community over time
3. Model the relationship between major disturbance events and coral benthic community

---
Data:
- Ecological surveys were conducted at Lizard Island reef between 1995 and 2022 as part of the AIMS Fixed sites long term monitoring program
- Sites were sampled every year from 1995 to 2005, and every second year from 2005 to 2022 which resulted in 20 different time points
- Each site consists of 5x50 m transects
- Each transect is positioned parallel to the reef slope using a line of tape
