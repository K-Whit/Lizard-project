**Project overview**

## Modelling 40 Years of Community Change on Lizard Reef: An Investigation into the Effects of Multiple Interacting Climate Change Factors

Aim:
- To model the effects of climate change on coral reefs


Objectives: 
1. Explore a range of potential environmental stressors based on existing literature 
2. Test our chosen factors in isolation and in combination to identify the main stressors that affect the reef over time
3. Attempt to define a set of parameters that can be used to predict future changes in coral cover

---
Analysis Plan:
1. plot change in coral cover over time
2. Plot change in coral community over time
3. Plot the annual anomaly temperature, salinity, sea level, turbidity, rainfall, wind, wave energy etc.
4. Plot major disturbance events, e.g. bleaching, cyclones
5. Make a plot that demonstrates the relationship between temporal trends in coral cover/community and environmental disturbance
